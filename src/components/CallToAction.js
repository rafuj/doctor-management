							Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and

							standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
							printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
							type specimen book. It has survived not only five
							centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
							remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
							1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
							Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
							software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
							Ipsum.
